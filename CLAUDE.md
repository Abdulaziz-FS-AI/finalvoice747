# Project Instructions

## Development Process
- Brainstorm and ask questions first
- Never implement until explicitly told to "go"
- Always plan the solution before implementing
- Only create files when absolutely necessary
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Never proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested

## SQL/Database Guidelines - CRITICAL
- SQL is difficult for beginners to understand and edit
- ALWAYS document every SQL command with clear explanations
- NEVER create multiple schema files - maintain ONE clean schema.sql
- When updating database schema:
  1. Replace existing schema.sql, don't create new files
  2. Keep file structure minimal and organized
  3. Remove unused/deprecated SQL files immediately
  4. Add detailed comments explaining each table, field, and function
- When user asks for "just auth" or specific parts, provide ONLY what's requested
- Don't add extra tables or functionality not specifically asked for

## File Organization Rules
- Keep everything clean and minimal
- Remove unused files immediately when they're no longer needed
- One file per purpose - no duplicates
- Follow user's explicit instructions about what to include/exclude

## SaaS Development Guidelines
- Focus on planning and understanding requirements first
- Ask clarifying questions to understand the business model, target users, and technical requirements
- Break down complex features into manageable components
- Consider scalability, security, and user experience from the start
